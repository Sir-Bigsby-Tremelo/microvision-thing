# microvision-thing
Persistance of vision work using a bbc microbit. timed_hello_pov = The basic code. This displays the word HELLO when pin0 reads high. microvision = all letters are mapped and called using the string "word" at line 249. This automatically switches between displaying on the LED matrix of the microbit and the external LEDs by detecting if a voltage is applied across pin0. To get this to work on the external LEDs you may need to reset the microbit whilst the reed switch is over the magnet.
